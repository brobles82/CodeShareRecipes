		  	<h2>What is CodeShare ?</h2>
		  	<p>
		  		To us, learn to code involves share your knowledge with other, so we planned this page as a central repo for all your recipes and tutorials, and make users able to share them, as simple as that, no complex features, no hard process.
		  	</p>
		  	
		  	<p>
		  		Sure, there are alot of guides/blogs all around internet, there is also github etc as a central repo but .......
		  		Have you tried to find something on github ? Is a hell !!!, also the amount of blogs that have old code in versions that now dont work , or code that never worked ?
		  		Sure you experienced the fustration of check for days on blogs, books etc and didn't found the solution..
		  	</p>

		  	<h2>The problem</h2>
		  	<p>
		  		Most of the blogs out there, guides etc have old content, and alot of them have complex examples that you really dont need.
		  	</p>

		  	<p>
		  		Imagine you are looking for an example of a code that adds a functionality to a post, and all you can find is examples of full blogs with alot of complex features that you really dont need.
		  	</p>

		  	<p>
		  		Then you get the code that you need from the example and implement it on your code and.... tadaaa dont works...
		  		Then the proccess starts again... look for other code example... extract what you need...
		  	</p>

		  	<h2>Our Solution</h2>
		  	<p>
		  		We created CodeRecipes for share little code recipes and tutorials  that WORK, so you can just underestand how that little piece of code works and implement it on your code. Thats is noting more simple !!!
